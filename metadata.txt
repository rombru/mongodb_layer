about=  The QGIS MongoDB Layer plugin facilitates seamless integration between QGIS
        and MongoDB databases, enabling users to create layers directly from MongoDB datasources with ease.
        Users can select databases, collections, and geometry fields effortlessly,
        import documents as features, and apply filters for dataset refinement.
        The plugin supports various geometry types, intelligently handles nested geometries,
        and allows retrieval of a mix of multi and simple geometries from the same collection.
        Asynchronous loading ensures faster layer loading times, enhancing productivity and
        efficiency in spatial data analysis workflows.
